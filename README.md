# Battleship
Implementation of the strategy game *Battleship*.

## Running
From the project root: ``python -m battleship``

## Feature workflow
1. ``git checkout master``
2. ``git pull``
3. ``git checkout -b <branch-name>``
4. Write working code.
   - You can run the test suite with ``python -m unittest discover``, though it would be more helpful to check against the unit(s) targeting your feature: ``python -m unittest tests.<test-filename>.<FeatureTestCaseClassName>``.
5. Commit working code.
6. ``git push origin <branch-name>``
7. Repeat until your feature is done.
8. Create a pull request from ``<branch-name>`` to ``master`` on GitHub.
